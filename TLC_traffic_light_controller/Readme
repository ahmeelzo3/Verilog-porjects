🚦 Smart Traffic Light Controller (Verilog FPGA)

A robust and synthesizable implementation of a smart Traffic Light Control System using Verilog HDL. The system is designed using a Finite State Machine (FSM) coupled with a flexible N-bit timer module. It handles traffic flow based on sensor inputs and timing constraints, ensuring safety and efficiency.

✨ Features

Intelligent Control: Automatically switches priority between two roads (Road A and Road B) based on sensor detection.

FSM Architecture: Clean separation of Sequential Logic, Next-State Logic, and Output Logic (Moore Machine) to prevent latches and glitches.

Modular Design:

fsm_controller.v: The brain of the system.

timer_nbit.v: A configurable N-bit timer for precise timing delays.

traffic_light_controller.v: The top-level module integrating both components.

Robust Simulation: Verified using a comprehensive Testbench (tb_traffic_light_system.v) that covers all operational states and edge cases.

Latch-Free Design: Carefully coded to ensure all logic paths are defined, preventing unwanted latches during synthesis.

🛠️ System Architecture

The system consists of two main modules:

FSM Controller:

Monitors sensor inputs (s_a, s_b) and the timer status (timer_done).

Controls the traffic lights (Ga, Ya, Ra, Gb, Yb, Rb).

Sets the t_max value for the timer depending on the current state (e.g., 60s for Green, 5s for Yellow).

N-bit Timer:

A generic counter that counts up to a specific t_max.

Signals the FSM when the time is up.

🚀 How to Run

Prerequisites

Xilinx Vivado, ModelSim, or any Verilog simulator.

Simulation Steps (Vivado)

Create a new project in Vivado.

Add the source files (.v) from the RTL folder.

Add the testbench file (tb_traffic_light_system.v) as a simulation source.

Set tb_traffic_light_system as the top module.

Run Behavioral Simulation.

Observe the waveforms for Ga, Ra, t, and other signals.

📊 Logic Flow (State Diagram)

s0: Road A Green, Road B Red (Default). Waits for timer or Sensor B.

s1: Road A Yellow, Road B Red.

s2: Road A Red, Road B Green.

s3: Decision State (Check sensors).

s4: Extend Green B if traffic exists only on B.

s5: Road A Red, Road B Yellow (Transition back to A).
